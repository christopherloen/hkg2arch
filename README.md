# hkg2arch - 0.1
A simple script to generate PKGBUILDs for haskell packages. Language: Bash
usage: hkg2arch [HKGNAME] [HKGVER] [options]
    examples:
    - hkg2arch curl 1.3.8 [create PKGBUILD for curl-1.3.8]
#Installation

git clone https://github.com/christopherloen/hkg2arch.git

cd hkg2arch && chmod +x hkg2arch

cp hkg2arch /usr/bin (this as root)

But you can find hkg2arch on AUR, so I suggest to get it from there.
